# What is this?
Cppnake - is my pet project, port of famous game 'Snake' to C++ and ncurses. Hope you'll enjoy it!

# How to install
If you're using Linux, just download the `out` file, and run it inside your console.

If you're NOT using Linux, then just compile it with your favourite compiler.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have installed <ncurses.h> lib to compile it.
